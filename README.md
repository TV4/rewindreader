`rewindreader` is a Go package that seamlessly buffers a stream of data to allow
reading part of the stream (for example a header of some kind) and then
rewinding it to be able to read the data in full from the start of the stream.

## Installation
```
go get -u github.com/TV4/rewindreader
```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
	"strings"

	"github.com/TV4/rewindreader"
)

func main() {
	rwr := rewindreader.New(strings.NewReader("foo bar baz"))

	io.CopyN(os.Stdout, rwr, 3)
	fmt.Println()

	if err := rwr.Rewind(); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	io.Copy(os.Stdout, rwr)
	fmt.Println()
}
```

Output:
```
foo
foo bar baz
```
